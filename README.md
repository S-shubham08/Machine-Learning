# Machine Learning
This repository is created for learning the different machine learning algorithms with Python, as well as self-learning projects I have completed in my academic studies. The explanations of each algorithm are included in corresponding Jupyter notebooks.

### The following algorithm explanations and execution have been added in respective jupyter notebooks:
 - Regression Algorithm
 - Classification Algorithm
 - Logistic Regression
 - Decision Tree and Random Forest
 - K-Means Clustering
 - Hierarchical Clustering
 - Time Series Modeling

### Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing:
In this Project, we will perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset and will also perform dimensionality reduction using an XGBoost algorithm to predict the test.
